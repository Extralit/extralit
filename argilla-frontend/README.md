Extralit is an open-source platform that transforms how researchers extract structured data from scientific literature. If you want to get started, we recommend checking out our [documentation](https://docs.extralit.ai).

This repository contains developer information about the frontend. For general usage, please refer to our [main repository](https://github.com/extralit/extralit).

## 🖥️ Frontend Development

### 💣 Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

### 🚀 Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 🌏 Build Locally

```bash
npm run build
```

## 📏 Core Principles

- **Open Science**: Extralit is free, open-source, and designed to accelerate scientific research by making data extraction from literature more efficient and reliable.

- **End-to-end**: Most extraction tools treat data collection as a one-off activity. In real scientific reviews, data extraction is an iterative process requiring validation and refinement. Extralit streamlines this workflow from raw PDFs to analysis-ready datasets.

- **User Experience**: The key to sustainable scientific data extraction is making it accessible for everyone. Domain experts should feel comfortable validating extracted data. Data scientists should be able to quickly iterate on extraction pipelines. Engineers should have control over deployment and scaling.

- **Human-in-the-Loop**: While AI can accelerate extraction, human validation remains essential for research-grade data quality. Extralit combines automated extraction with efficient human validation workflows to ensure accuracy.
