# CLI Migration Plan: Argilla v1 to v2

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to migrate the CLI functionality from Argilla v1 to Argilla v2. The CLI was removed in v2, but many researchers prefer using it over the Python SDK. This migration will restore CLI functionality in v2.

## Implementation Notes

### Key Challenges
1. **API Differences**: The v2 API may differ from v1, requiring command adaptation
2. **Import Structure**: All imports need to be updated from `argilla_v1` to `argilla`
3. **Dependencies**: Some v1 CLI features might depend on v1-specific functionality
4. **Testing**: Ensuring commands work correctly with the v2 backend
5. **Error Handling**: Implementing comprehensive error handling and logging
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining compatibility with v1 commands through aliases
7. **Documentation**: Creating clear and comprehensive documentation for users
8. **API Compatibility Layer**: Creating a layer to handle differences between v1 and v2 APIs
9. **Configuration Management**: Handling configuration files and environment variables
10. **Performance**: Ensuring CLI commands perform well with large datasets

### Implementation Strategy
- Port one module at a time, starting with simpler commands
- Test each module thoroughly before moving to the next
- Keep the same command structure where possible for backward compatibility
- Document any necessary changes to command syntax or behavior
- Replace all mock implementations with real API calls
- Ensure proper error handling for all API interactions

### Required Changes in `pyproject.toml`
- Add CLI entry point in `argilla/pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[project.scripts]
argilla = "argilla.cli.app:app"
```
