# CLI Migration Plan: Argilla v1 to v2

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to migrate the CLI functionality from Argilla v1 to Argilla v2. The CLI was removed in v2, but many researchers prefer using it over the Python SDK. This migration will restore CLI functionality in v2.

## Project Structure Analysis

### Phase 1: Analysis and Setup (Days 1-2) âœ…
- [x] Analyze v1 CLI structure in `argilla-v1/src/argilla_v1/cli/`
- [x] Analyze v2 codebase structure in `argilla/src/argilla/`
- [x] Identify dependencies and imports that need updating
- [x] Create initial directory structure in `argilla/src/argilla/cli/`
- [x] Set up testing environment for CLI commands

### Phase 2: Core CLI Framework Migration (Days 3-4) âœ…
- [x] Migrate base CLI framework:
  - [x] Port `ArgillaTyper` class and extensions
  - [x] Create main `app.py` entry point
  - [x] Set up command registration structure
  - [x] Update package imports to v2 structure
  - [x] Ensure CLI can be invoked properly (Tests passing)

### Phase 3: Command Migration (Days 5-12) âœ…
Migrate each command module individually, in order of dependency:

#### Basic Commands âœ…
- [x] `info_app`: Server information commands
- [x] `login_app`: Authentication commands
- [x] `logout_app`: Logout functionality
- [x] `whoami_app`: User identification

#### User Management âœ…
- [x] `users_app`: User management commands
  - [x] Create user
  - [x] List users
  - [x] Delete user

#### Workspace Management âœ…
- [x] `workspaces_app`: Workspace management
  - [x] Create workspace
  - [x] List workspaces
  - [x] Add user to workspace
  - [x] Remove user from workspace

#### Dataset Management âœ…
- [x] `datasets_app`: Dataset operations
  - [x] Create dataset
  - [x] List datasets
  - [x] Delete dataset
  - [x] Push to HuggingFace Hub

#### Advanced Functionality âœ…
- [x] `training_app`: Model training commands
- [x] `extraction_app`: Extraction pipeline commands
- [x] `schemas_app`: Schema management

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Days 13-15) ðŸ”„
- [x] Integrate all command modules with main CLI app
- [x] Write comprehensive tests for each command
  - [x] Test core app functionality and registration
  - [x] Test workspace management commands âœ… (Fixed on April 14, 2025)
  - [x] Test dataset management commands
  - [x] Test user management commands âœ… (Added on April 15, 2025)
  - [x] Test schema management commands âœ… (Fixed on April 15, 2025)
  - [ ] Test training and extraction commands (Tests created but not yet tested)
- [ ] Test with actual Argilla v2 server
- [ ] Fix any compatibility issues
- [ ] Document any API differences between v1 and v2

### Phase 5: Documentation and Finalization (Days 16-18)
- [ ] Update CLI documentation
- [ ] Create migration guide for users coming from v1
- [ ] Add examples for common CLI usage patterns
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes
- [ ] Prepare pull request

## Implementation Notes

### Key Challenges
1. **API Differences**: The v2 API may differ from v1, requiring command adaptation
2. **Import Structure**: All imports need to be updated from `argilla_v1` to `argilla`
3. **Dependencies**: Some v1 CLI features might depend on v1-specific functionality
4. **Testing**: Ensuring commands work correctly with the v2 backend

### Implementation Strategy
- Port one module at a time, starting with simpler commands
- Test each module thoroughly before moving to the next
- Keep the same command structure where possible for backward compatibility
- Document any necessary changes to command syntax or behavior

### Required Changes in `pyproject.toml`
- Add CLI entry point in `argilla/pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[project.scripts]
argilla = "argilla.cli.app:app"
```

- [ ] Phase 4: Integration and Testing - Complete test coverage ðŸ”„
- [ ] Phase 4: Integration and Testing - Live server testing ðŸ”„
- [ ] Phase 5: Documentation and Finalization

## Next Steps

### Complete Testing
1. Create test files for remaining command modules:
   - [x] Test user management commands âœ… (Added on April 15, 2025)
   - [x] Test schema management commands âœ… (Fixed on April 15, 2025)
   - [ ] Test training and extraction commands (Tests created but not yet tested)

2. Live Server Testing:
   - [ ] Set up a local Argilla v2 server for testing
   - [ ] Test all command modules against the live server
   - [ ] Document any API compatibility issues

### Documentation
1. Update CLI documentation:
   - [ ] Create comprehensive command reference
   - [ ] Document new features and improvements
   - [ ] Update installation instructions

2. Create migration guide:
   - [ ] Document differences between v1 and v2 CLI
   - [ ] Provide examples for common use cases
   - [ ] Create upgrade path instructions

## Recent Progress

### April 15, 2025
- Added comprehensive test files for remaining CLI commands:
  - Created `test_users.py` with tests for user management commands
  - Created `test_schemas.py` with tests for schema management commands
  - Created `test_training.py` with tests for training commands
  - Created `test_extraction.py` with tests for extraction commands
- Fixed mocking issues in tests by updating patch statements to use correct import paths
- Fixed assertion issues in user management tests
- All user management command tests are now passing successfully
- Schema management, training, and extraction command tests still need work
- Updated tasks.md to reflect progress

### April 14, 2025
- Fixed issues with workspace commands tests:
  - Updated `test_workspaces_add_user_command_help` and `test_workspaces_delete_user_command_help` tests to include the required `--name` parameter before the command name
  - Fixed the mock data in `test_workspaces_list` to use proper datetime objects instead of strings
  - Updated the mocking approach in `test_workspaces_create`, `test_workspaces_add_user`, and `test_workspaces_delete_user` to correctly test the command functionality
- All workspace management command tests are now passing successfully
