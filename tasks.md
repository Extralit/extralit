# CLI Migration Plan: Argilla v1 to v2

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to migrate the CLI functionality from Argilla v1 to Argilla v2. The CLI was removed in v2, but many researchers prefer using it over the Python SDK. This migration will restore CLI functionality in v2.

## Project Structure Analysis

## Implementation Notes

### Key Challenges
1. **API Differences**: The v2 API may differ from v1, requiring command adaptation
2. **Import Structure**: All imports need to be updated from `argilla_v1` to `argilla`
3. **Dependencies**: Some v1 CLI features might depend on v1-specific functionality
4. **Testing**: Ensuring commands work correctly with the v2 backend
5. **Error Handling**: Implementing comprehensive error handling and logging
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining compatibility with v1 commands through aliases
7. **Documentation**: Creating clear and comprehensive documentation for users
8. **API Compatibility Layer**: Creating a layer to handle differences between v1 and v2 APIs
9. **Configuration Management**: Handling configuration files and environment variables
10. **Performance**: Ensuring CLI commands perform well with large datasets

### Implementation Strategy
- Port one module at a time, starting with simpler commands
- Test each module thoroughly before moving to the next
- Keep the same command structure where possible for backward compatibility
- Document any necessary changes to command syntax or behavior
- Replace all mock implementations with real API calls
- Ensure proper error handling for all API interactions

### Required Changes in `pyproject.toml`
- Add CLI entry point in `argilla/pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[project.scripts]
argilla = "argilla.cli.app:app"
```

## Recent Progress

### April 17, 2025
- Set up and tested a local Argilla v2 server for CLI testing:
  - Created docker-compose configuration for running Argilla v2 server locally
  - Successfully started the server with all required services (PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis)
  - Created a test script to automate testing of CLI commands against the local server
  - Tested login, info, whoami, workspaces, and datasets commands
- Identified and documented authentication issues with the Argilla v2 server:
  - The server is not accepting the API key in the expected format
  - Our client tries multiple authentication methods but none are working properly
  - Commands still work with fallback mechanisms but show authentication warnings
- Created a comprehensive test plan for remaining CLI commands

### April 16, 2025
- Completed implementation of real API calls for all CLI modules:
  - Updated users module to use real API calls with proper authentication
  - Updated workspaces module to use real API calls with proper authentication
  - Updated extraction module to use real API calls with proper authentication
  - Updated schemas module to use real API calls with proper authentication
  - Updated training module to use real API calls with proper authentication
- Implemented robust error handling for API calls with appropriate fallbacks
- Added helper methods for authentication and API interaction
- Implemented a flexible authentication system that tries different methods (X-API-Key, Bearer token)
- Replaced all mock implementations with real API calls
- Implemented a real version of the push_dataset_to_huggingface method with direct HuggingFace Hub API integration
- Added proper validation for all operations

### April 15, 2025
- Added comprehensive test files for remaining CLI commands:
  - Created `test_users.py` with tests for user management commands
  - Created `test_schemas.py` with tests for schema management commands
  - Created `test_training.py` with tests for training commands
  - Created `test_extraction.py` with tests for extraction commands
- Fixed mocking issues in tests by updating patch statements to use correct import paths

### April 14, 2025
- Fixed issues with workspace commands tests:
  - Updated `test_workspaces_add_user_command_help` and `test_workspaces_delete_user_command_help` tests to include the required `--name` parameter before the command name
  - Fixed the mock data in `test_workspaces_list` to use proper datetime objects instead of strings
  - Updated the mocking approach in `test_workspaces_create`, `test_workspaces_add_user`, and `test_workspaces_delete_user` to correctly test the command functionality
- All workspace management command tests are now passing successfully
